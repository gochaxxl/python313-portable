## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Extract the archive

Unpack `python313-portable.7z` to any folder, e.g. `C:\MyTools\python313-portable`

### 2. (Optional) Add to user PATH

Run:

```cmd
add_to_path.bat

You’ll be prompted for confirmation before anything is added.
This only modifies the user PATH (HKCU), never the system PATH.
